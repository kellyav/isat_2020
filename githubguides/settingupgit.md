# A guide on how to set up your environment for Github (*For Windows*)


Windows machines may not automatically come with the capacity to run Git off the bat. 

If you get an error message like:

```
'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file. 
```

Then you will need to download git in order to use command line. Dont worry, it is simple and secure to do so!


## Download Git 
For windows: (https://git-scm.com/download/win)

## Set it up
Open the file that is downloaded from the website above. 

Go through all of the steps of the download manager and it should be saved onto your computer.

Open the Command Prompt app. If you opened it prior to downloading the necessary git packages you may need to restart the app to load git.

### Now you are ready to initalize git!
Where to go from here?
