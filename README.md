# isat_2020
Code I've written for the Programming & Problem Solving course in the Integrated Science and Technology (ISAT) concentration, taken in Spring 2020 at JMU.

## Semester Progress
I created all these repositories that I have up on Github this year (8). 
As of May 1st 2020, I have done the following: 

- *Completed a datacamp project* on Covid19: https://github.com/kellyav/rfiles/tree/master/Visualizing%20COVID-19

- practice on https://exercism.io/my/tracks

### Repos:
- Coded and uploaded *9 solutions to Project Euler problems*. https://github.com/kellyav/eulers_solutions/tree/master/Solutions

As well as supporting functions for these problems: https://github.com/kellyav/eulers_solutions/tree/master/supporting%20functions


- *Started learning Javascript*. Watched tutorials from class, and from Revature. https://app.revature.com/dCourseVideos/Introduction%20to%20Java-6 
https://github.com/kellyav/javafiles

- Arabic to Roman repo: https://github.com/kellyav/arabic2roman



I am now well versed in R, Matlab, Python and Javascript. I also use UiPath for another class. 

### fizzbuzz_stuff folder 
includes my original two attempts to write a code to play the 'Fizzbuzz game' called fizzbuzz_simple.py and fizzbuzz_list.py, as well as a new code written using pytest and test driven development. 

In other words, solution.py, fizzbuzz_test.py, and functions.py together create a code that works and was written by writing code that fails tests using the command line, until the code passes the tests. Each test case fails initially, to ensure that the test works and can catch errors.

### githubguides folder
includes my own written how-to's for using Github. Also includes my own tips and tricks I have learned during the process.
