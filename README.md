# isat_2020
Code I've written for the Programming & Problem Solving course in the Integrated Science and Technology (ISAT) concentration, taken in Spring 2020 at JMU.

## fizzbuzz_stuff folder 
includes my original two attempts to write a code to play the 'Fizzbuzz game' called fizzbuzz_simple.py and fizzbuzz_list.py, as well as a new code written using test driven development. 

In other words, solution.py, fizzbuzz_test.py, and functions.py together create a code that works and was written by writing code that fails tests using the command line, until the code passes the tests. Each test case fails initially, to ensure that the test works and can catch errors.

## githubguides folder
includes my own written how-to's for using Github. Also includes my own tips and tricks I have learned during the process.
